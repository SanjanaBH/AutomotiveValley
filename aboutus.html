        <h3><i>FERRUCCIO LAMBORGHINI</i></h3>
        <h5>Founder</h5>
        <p>
          The history of ‘Lamborghini Automobili’ officially starts in 1963.
          Nevertheless, we must consider the distant roots of this event, and
          they are the roots of Ferruccio Lamborghini. Born in 1916, this
          capable, impetuous, strong-willed Taurus was the leading character in
          the foundation of the company and the early phases of its
          extraordinary history. By the time he decided to build a factory of
          luxury sports cars, Ferruccio was already a very wealthy man. In the
          period following World War II, he founded his tractor factory, which
          he launched with energy and determination, creating a major point of
          reference in this industry.

        <h3><i>MARCELLO GANDINI</i></h3>
        <h5>Designer</h5>
        <p>
          Marcello Gandini was born in Turin on August 26, 1938 and designed
          some of the most stunning Italian motor vehicles from the mid sixties
          onwards. Even if his creative skills were employed primarily in the
          design of cars, he was also involved in industrial design and home
          accessories. He was head designer at Bertone until 1980, when he
          decided on a change of direction and became a freelance designer. He
          took over from his contemporary Giorgetto Giugiaro at Bertone,
          designing the most popular Italian sports vehicles in '60s and '70s,
          including the famous Lamborghini Miura and Countach

        <h3>GIAMPAOLO DALLARA</h3>
        <h5>Engineer</h5>
        <p>
          Giampaolo Dallara was born on November 16, 1936, in Varano de'
          Melegari, near Parma. He studied Aeronautical Engineering at Milan’s
          Politecnico University, graduating in 1959. He joined Automobili
          Lamborghini in 1963 as Technical Director, remaining until 1969: these
          were the years of the 350 GT, the Miura and the Espada. Together with
          Stanzani and Gandini, he has always been considered one of the fathers
          of the Miura from the point of view of its technical development.
